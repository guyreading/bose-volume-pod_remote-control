# bose-volume-pod_remote-control
This project is to control your bose volume control pod using a TV remote control. It is split into 2 sections:

1. Identifying which buttons you'd like to map to volume up & volume down & finding out their HEX key that your specific remote control sends ("finding_out_codes").

2. Mapping the vol up and vol down hex keys to the stepper motor clockwise and anti-clockwise movement ("remote control").


The wiring for the stepper motor and IR sensor is straight-forward.
